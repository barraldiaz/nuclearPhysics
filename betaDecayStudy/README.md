# betaDecayStudy

This folder contains a set of scripts used to analize the beta decay behaviour of the Galium nuclei, and its ground level beta intensity
The scripts print the beta intensity per level (see plots), obtains ground level beta decay for the simulated events and for also random simulated levels
